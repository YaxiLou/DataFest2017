## Workshop Focus

- Get your team ready to _collaborate_.
    - Organize team files/folders.
    - Share code/data.
- Share strategies to streamline Night 1.
    - Read-in and simplify data.
    - Clean and tidy data.
    - Decipher variables.

## DataFest Workshops

Tonight:

- Spend about an hour talking about the basics of collaborating & managing a team along with some tips on how to spend Night 1.
- Afterwards: Hang out to answer questions, make recommendations for advanced collaboration workflows, talk about my cat or coffee or anything y'all want. 

## DataFest Workshops

Next week:

- Focus on workflows for _Exploratory Data Analysis_ using the `tidyverse` set of packages.

## Who am I?

I am James.

- Ph.D. Candidate in statistics.
- Avid **R** user.

Projects I've worked on:
    
- Collaborated with Math & CS grad students to analyze some fairly large [Yelp! data](https://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge)
- Collaborated with my Ph.D. adviser, [Rick Paik Schoenberg]() & other grad students in statistical seismology.
- Wrote labs and developed the package used in the [Mobilize Introduction to Data Science](http://www.mobilizingcs.org/introduction-to-data-science) high school math course.

## My Role in DataFest

Planning

- Work with data providers to refine data sets for the competition
- Schedule grad student helpers and outside VIPs.

Consulting

- Hang out on Night 1 to help teams get going.
- Hang out on final day to help teams finish their analysis.


# Common DataFest Issues

## The _Too many cooks in the kitchen_ Problem

Individual team members:

- Write code that works on their laptops.
- Use file names that aren't descriptive (Except to themselves).
- Share the files via e-mail.

## The _Too many cooks in the kitchen_ Problem

By the last day, the team's code:
    
- Is scattered across numerous e-mail threads.
- Doesn't run without modifications (Often lots of them).
- Requires one team member to create new code files by copy/pasting, fixing, adjusting, modifying, etc. the group's code into something that kinda works.

## The _My team is awful and I hate them_ problem

Individual team members:

- Have varying level of coding/data-analysis skills.
- Work individually on the data analysis, often replicating others work on their own computers.
- Have different interests/personalities.

## The _My team is awful and I hate them_ problem

By the last day, the team:

- Is fragmented (Often some team members have quit).
- Has one team member doing all of the work or making all of the decisions.
- Over-stressed and scrambling to do anything that they can present to the judges.

## The _Data analysis starts with k-means_ problem

Night one:

- The data provider reveals the data.
- Teams get the data, read it into their computers and ...
- ... immediatly run the most complicated algorithm they can find.

## The _Data analysis starts with k-means_ problem

Which results in:

- Teams wasting valuable time on models/outputs that...
- ... they don't understand.
- ... pigeon hole them into solving some problem that was only marginally interesting in the first place.
- ... Limits their understanding of what exactly is in the data and what it means.

## The _Data analysis starts with k-means_ problem

And since people are all using different computers with different specs:

- Each team member has a modified data file that works on their own computers but is meaningless to everyone elses.
- Team members on less powerful laptops waste their time doing simple things (Like reading in the data).
- Marks the beginning of the _My team is awful and I hate them_ problem.

### How do we help/solve these problems?


# Day Zero

## Before DataFest

Meet as a team

- Organize and establish a system to share code files.
- Establish Night 1 roles/tasks.
- Learn about your team member's strengths and weaknesses.
- Decide how your team will make decisions related to the analysis.
- Establish a time-frame to accomplish different tasks.

# Night One

After the data reveal:

- Carry out the assigned roles/tasks.
- Spend time learning what information is contained in the data.
- Read-in, simplify, share and clean the data.
- Begin exploring possible questions the data might answer.
- Assign each team member roles/responsibilities to work on Night 1 and the next day.
